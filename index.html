	Have you ever considered building your new home from the ground up? One of the best ways to get a custom-built house is with shell construction. This process can be time consuming and costly, but it offers many benefits that are worth exploring!One benefit of this type of construction is an increased energy efficiency. The framing components for this style of construction are prefabricated and then assembled on site. This increases the amount of insulation that is needed to keep your home warm in winter and cool in summer, saving you money as a result!Shell homes also tend to be much more affordable than other types because there’s no need for concrete or brick foundations. The roofing and exterior walls are already in place so you can skip all of the costly foundation work.
